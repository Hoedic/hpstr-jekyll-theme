*An old man turned ninety-eight<BR>He won the lottery and died the next day<BR>[...]<BR>Isn't it ironic... don't you think*

*It's like rain on your wedding day<BR>It's a free ride when you've already paid<BR>It's the good advice that you just didn't take<BR>[...]*

*Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly<BR>He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye<BR>He waited his whole damn life to take that flight<BR>And as the plane crashed down he thought<BR>"Well, isn't this nice."<BR>And isn't it ironic ... don't you think*

*[...]*

*A traffic jam when you're already late<BR>A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break<BR>It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife<BR>It's meeting the man of my dreams<BR>And then meeting his beautiful wife<BR>And isn't it ironic... don't you think<BR>[...]*
