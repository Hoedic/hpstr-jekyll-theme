Un  pour le moins corrosif à l'encontre des ONG dans leur forme actuelle sur le blog collaboratif  :

<blockquote class="citation">Right now, most advocacy NGOs consider their members like you and me mostly as a source of small donations. By and large, they couldn't care less what we think, how we act, who we know and how strongly we're committed, as long as we keep writing those $35.00 checks for our "memberships." By and large, those memberships bring us nothing [...] often an increase in the amount of junk solicitations clogging our mailboxes. These "premiums" betray NGO membership for what it frankly usually is, a cheap shill, playing on our guilt or idealism, for support by people who'd rather not be bothered with us, and who, in any case, look at us almost exactly as late night infomercial hucksters look at the folks on the other side of the television screen: as a market.</blockquote>
