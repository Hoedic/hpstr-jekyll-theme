*Moral education, as I understand it, is not about inculcating obedience to law or cultivating self-virtue,
it is rather about finding within us an ever-increasing sense of the worth of creation. It is about how we
can develop and deepen our intuitive sense of beauty and creativity.*  (Andrew Linzey) 

*When I despair...I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always won. There have been murderers and tyrants, and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it ... always.*  (Gandhi)

*Life is a matter of luck, and the oods in favor of success are in no way enhanced by extreme caution.*  (Erich Topp)
