*I found a dimpled spider, fat and white, <BR>On a white heal-all, holding up a moth <BR>Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth - <BR>Assorted characters of death and blight <BR>[...] *

*What had that flower to do with being white, <BR>The wayside blue and innocent heal-all? <BR>[...]<BR>What but design of darkness to appal? - <BR>If design govern in a thing so small.*

Robert Frost

Un poème rythmé sur la beauté, un hommage à la nature, tout simplement.
