*Men of genius are often dull and inert in society, as a blazing meteor when it descends to earth, is only a stone.*  (Longfellow)

*If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different  drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.*  (Thoreau)

*Experience shows that success is due less to ability than to zeal. The winner is he who gives himself to his work body and soul.*  (Charles Buxton)
