*True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no
power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists
of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect mankind has suffered a
fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it.*  (Milan Kundera) 

*The average beast of prey is a decent creature who merely kills for the sake of food or in a fight
against an enemy. It is only man who calls killing "sport" and kills for the pleasure of killing; not for
food, not for self-defense, but just to satisfy some primitive instinct, once necessary and now
perverted.*  (Gilbert Murray)

*Shame may restrain what law does not prohibit.*  (Seneca)
