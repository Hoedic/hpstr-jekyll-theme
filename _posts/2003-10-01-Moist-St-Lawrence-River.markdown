*[...]<BR>Caught in the rage and the fire of things<BR>All the brightness that burns me<BR>I'm fumbling through like a child in the dark<BR>When the nakedness comes<BR>I am shocked by the colour the glorious weight of your skin<BR>Comes alive*

*[...]*

*You are watching breathing and baiting<BR>Wanting and warming and cautiously waiting<BR>For some simple signal to creep cross your conscience<BR>Uncover redemption and oh did I mention<BR>I carried you down to the St. Lawrence River<BR>The banks running dirty the water's beginning to freeze here*

*[...]*

*I saw on your face such a curious grin<BR>As I let go your hand<BR>I was desperate to hold you again<BR>But you're sinking so deep in the water<BR>[...]*
