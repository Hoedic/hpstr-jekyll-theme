*Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <BR>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -<BR>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <BR>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door -<BR>"'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door -<BR>            Only this and nothing more."<BR><BR>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; <BR>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <BR>Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow <BR>From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -<BR>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -<BR>            Nameless here for evermore. *

*And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <BR>Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <BR>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, <BR>"'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door -<BR>Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; -<BR>            This it is and nothing more." *

*Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <BR>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <BR>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <BR>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <BR>That I scarce was sure I heard you " - here I opened wide the door; -<BR>            Darkness there and nothing more. *

*[...]*

*But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only <BR>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. <BR>Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered - <BR>Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before - <BR>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before." <BR>            Then the bird said "Nevermore." *

*Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, <BR>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store <BR>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster <BR>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore - <BR>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore <BR>            Of 'Never - nevermore'."*
