*Every civilizing step in history has been ridiculed as 'sentimental', 'impractical', or 'womanish', etc., by
those whose fun, profit or convenience was at stake.*  (Joan Gilbert) 

*Mankind continues to become gradually less cruel because a few people in every generation keep
saying, "This isn't right. It hurts me to see it."*  (Joan Gilbert)

*It is a proof of our natural bias to evil, that in all things good, gain is harder and slower than loss; but in
all things bad or evil, getting is quicker and easier than getting rid of them.*  (Hare & Charles)
