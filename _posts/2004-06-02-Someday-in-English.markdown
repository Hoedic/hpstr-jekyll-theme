I decided that my English needed some more practicing.  So you may come to read some of my posts written in Shakespeare's language from time to time.  I have been reading in English all day long for a year or so but I never get to write anything.  Time to change !

Then what I want to say today is :

*Someday* we'll reach the month of July and it will be time for Hoedic to finally receive his late birthday present from me.  I can't wait - and so must he !
