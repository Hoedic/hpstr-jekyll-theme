*Fear tastes like a rusty knife and do not let her into your house. Courage tastes of blood. Stand up straight. Admire the world. Relish the love of a gentle woman. Trust in the Lord.*  (John Cheever)

*I made my mistakes, but in all my years of public life I have never profited, never profited from public service. I have earned every cent.  I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.*  (Richard M. Nixon)

*When the President does it, that means that it is not illegal.*  (Richard M. Nixon)
