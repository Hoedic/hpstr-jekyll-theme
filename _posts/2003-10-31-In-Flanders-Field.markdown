*In Flanders fields the poppies blow<BR>Between the crosses, row on row<BR>That mark our place; and in the sky<BR>The larks, still bravely singing, fly<BR>Scarce heard amid the guns below.*

*We are the Dead. Short days ago<BR>We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<BR>Loved and were loved, and now we lie<BR>In Flanders fields.*

*Take up our quarrel with the foe:<BR>To you from failing hands we throw<BR>The torch; be yours to hold it high.<BR>If ye break faith with us who die<BR>We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<BR>In Flanders fields.*

Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, MD (1872-1918)<BR>Canadian Army
