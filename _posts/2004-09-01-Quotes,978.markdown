*We grow tyrannical fighting tyranny.  The most alarming spectacle today is not the spectacle of the atomic bomb in an unfederated world, it is the spectacle of the Americans beginning to accept the device of loyalty oaths and witchhunts, beginning to call anybody they don't like a Communist.*  (E.B. White)

*As long as there is one upright man, as long as there is one compassionate woman, the contagion may spread and the scene is not desolate. Hope is the thing that is left us in a bad time.*  (E.B. White)

*Why does my Muse only speak when she is unhappy ? She does not, I only listen when I am unhappy.*  (Stevie [Margaret Florence] Smith)
