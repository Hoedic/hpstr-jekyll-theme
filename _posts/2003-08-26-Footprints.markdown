*One night a man <BR>[...] dreamed <BR>he was walking along <BR>the beach with the Lord. <BR>[...] **he noticed <BR>two sets of footprints in the <BR>sand; one belonging to him, and <BR>the other to the Lord. *

*[...] he looked back at the <BR>footprints in the sand. He noticed that <BR>many times along the path of his life <BR>there was only one set of footprints.<BR>[...] **it happened at the very <BR>lowest and saddest times in his life. *

*[...] he <BR>questioned the Lord about it. "Lord, <BR>you said that once I decided to follow <BR>you, you'd walk with me all the way. <BR>But I have noticed that during the most <BR>troublesome times in my life, there is <BR>only one set of footprints. I don't <BR>understand why, when I needed you <BR>most, you would leave me." *

*The Lord replied, "My precious, <BR>precious child, I love you and I would <BR>never leave you. During your times of <BR>trial and suffering, when you saw only <BR>one set of footprints, it was then that I <BR>carried you."*
