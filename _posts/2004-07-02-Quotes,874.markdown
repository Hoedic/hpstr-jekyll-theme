*On the whole, it is patience which makes the final difference between those who succeed or fail in all
things. All the greatest people have it in an infinite degree, and among the less, the patient weak ones
always conquer the impatient strong.*  (John Ruskin) 

*Custom will reconcile people to any atrocity; and fashion will drive them to acquire any custom.*  (George Bernard Shaw)

*The decent moderation of today will be the least of human things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish
Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to
burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they
should burn none at all.*  (Maurice Maeterlinck)
