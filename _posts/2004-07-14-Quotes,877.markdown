*A bird in the hand is a certainty, but a bird in the bush may sing.*  (Bret Harte) 

*The zoo is a prison for animals who have been sentenced without trial and I feel guilty because I do
nothing about it. I wanted to see an oyster-catcher, so I was no better than the people who caged the
oyster-catcher for me to see.*  (Russell Hoban)

*We cannot glimpse the essential life of a caged animal, only the shadow of its former beauty.*  (Julia Allen Field)
