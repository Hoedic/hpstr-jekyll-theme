*Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination.*  (Ernest Hemingway)

*If it is any use to know it, I always try to write on the principle of the iceberg. There is seven-eighths of it under water for every part that shows. Anything you know you can eliminate and it only strengthens your iceberg. It is the part that doesn't show. If a writer omits something because he does not know it then there is a hole in the story.*  (Ernest Hemingway)

*Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time.*  (E.B. White)
